# DMFC
This is a project to simulate a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell.
It parts from the Jean Paul Kone's toolkit for a Hydrogen PEMFC.
The modified parts are the ones from the electrochemistry library,
From March 18, only one problem with the local current function is not solved.
Any feedback is appreciated.
You can use this only if you mention Jean Paul Kone.
Thank you.

Notes
It runs only in OpenFOAM 4.0
I haven't done any modifications to run it in the latest OF version, but you can do it if you want.
